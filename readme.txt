Figures 1-5:

(-) The folder '0. Model' contains general scripts concerning the biophysical model used in simulations for Figs. 1-5: model morphology, model equations, model parameters, ... 

(-) Folders Fig 1 to Fig 5 contain scripts to generate the necessary data used for respective figures in the article, using the biophysical neuron model the from '0. Model' folder.

(-) All scripts were written to be compatible with Python3.5 and Brian2 v2.0.

Figure 6:

(-) The folders 'Model CPU' and 'Model GPU' contain general scripts concerning the reduced model used in simulations for Fig 6. 

(-) The folder Fig 6 contains scripts to generate the necessary data used for figure 6. 

(-) All scripts were written to be compatible with Python3.5 with the tensorflow package (to run on GPU).
